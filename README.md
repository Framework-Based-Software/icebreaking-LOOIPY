[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,py,php,unity,cs,cpp,androidstudio,arduino,bootstrap,firebase)](https://skillicons.dev)

By the end of this course, I expect to have a clear understanding of the frameworks currently used in the industry and their role in modern software development. I aim to develop the necessary skills to implement these frameworks effectively and apply best practices in real-world scenarios. 

Through hands-on experience and practical exercises, I want to become familiar with the framework learned, gaining confidence in its usage and integration within software projects. Ultimately, this course should equip me with the knowledge and practical skills needed to work efficiently with industry-standard frameworks and enhance my ability to develop scalable and maintainable applications.
